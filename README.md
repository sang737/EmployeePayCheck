# Project Overview

This initiative involves the development of a system designed to compute employee deductions based on specified employee criteria.

Considered Criteria
The system enables the viewing of employees along with their respective dependents.
• Employees and their dependents can be observed.
• Each employee is limited to either 1 spouse or 1 domestic partner, not both.
• Employees are unrestricted in the number of children they can claim as dependents.
• The system is capable of computing and displaying an employee's paycheck, following these guidelines:
• A total of 26 paychecks are distributed throughout the year, with deductions evenly distributed across each paycheck.
• Employees carry a fundamental monthly cost of $1,000 for benefits.
• Each dependent adds an extra monthly cost of $600 for benefits.
• Employees earning above $80,000 annually will face an added benefits cost of 2% of their yearly salary.
• Dependents aged 50 or older will lead to an additional monthly cost of $200.
